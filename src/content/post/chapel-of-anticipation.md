Here, players are introduced to the mechanics of the game, as they discover the dead maiden inside the chapel containing the **Tarnished's Wizened Finger**.

The initial encounter with the **Grafted Scion** serves as a rite of passage, emphasizing the game’s unforgiving nature. This formidable foe leaps from the air, attacking players as they entered the open courtyard, setting the stage for the challenges ahead. While defeat is almost inevitable, it acts as a catalyst, transporting players to the **Stranded Graveyard** and marking the beginning of their true journey.

The Chapel of Anticipation is a transitory space imbued with symbolism. This is further highlighted when players return later in the game, armed with new knowledge and equipment. The unlocked door reveals treasures like the **Stormhawk Deenh** and **The Stormhawk King**, deepening the connection to the overarching narrative. This initial location, with its tangible ties to the lore and gameplay mechanics, is a crucial element in the unfolding epic of **Elden Ring**.

The **Chapel of Anticipation** is a poignant entry point into the enigmatic landscape of Elden Ring, a realm defined by its intricate lore and interwoven narratives.

Theories abound regarding the chapel's role as a transitory space, a gateway through which the Tarnished enter the **Lands Between**.

### The Dead Maiden in the Chapel of Anticipation

The presence of the **dead maiden in the Chapel of Anticipation** is a poignant symbol of the **Tarnished's fate** and a mystery that beckons exploration. Her lifeless form, found in an environment marred by chaos and ruin, suggests a violent end. Theories abound regarding her demise, with many pointing fingers at the **Grafted Scion**, a powerful creature stationed nearby, potentially acting on Godrick's orders to thwart the Tarnished's journey.

The chapel itself, with its shattered roof and eerie silence, hints at a past calamity, further deepened by the notion that this maiden might have once been a companion to the player character, a notion that ties into the lore of the **Tarnished's maidenless state**.

The **environmental storytelling** of the chapel paints a picture of anticipation and loss. The architectural anomalies, such as the mix of rounded and pointed arches, and the cobweb-laden interiors, speak of a place long abandoned, waiting for an awaited return. This setting, combined with the maiden's death, suggests a **sacrificial act or a failed guardian role**, where she might have given herself to revive the player character, allowing them to rise and embark on their quest. This act of sacrifice could explain the unique ability of the player to still see the **Guidance of Grace**, unlike other Tarnished, adding a layer of depth to the maiden's tragic end and the player's ensuing journey.

### The Purpose of the Chapel of Anticipation

The **Chapel of Anticipation** stands as a monumental gateway into the enigmatic world of Elden Ring, serving as both a transitory space and a **symbolic entryway for the Tarnished**.

As a transitory space, the Chapel of Anticipation embodies the liminality of the lands between, a bridge between the known world and the mysterious realms beyond. Its isolated position, accessible only through the mist and later via the Waygate at **The Four Belfries**, reinforces its nature as a portal, a passage for the Tarnished to reclaim their destiny. The presence of the **Grafted Scion**, a formidable guardian placed by Godrick, adds a layer of challenge and intrigue, testing the mettle of the player right from the outset.

Upon stepping into the courtyard of the **Chapel of Anticipation**, players are introduced to the formidable **Grafted Scion**, a multi-limbed monstrosity that leaps from above to challenge the Tarnished.

Understanding its attack patterns and maintaining distance is crucial for survival, as this foe's powerful strikes can swiftly bring about defeat.

The significance of this battle lies not only in its difficulty but in its symbolic representation of the challenges that await the Tarnished. Defeating the Scion rewards players with the **Ornamental Straight Sword** and **Golden Beast Crest Shield**, which are early tokens of perseverance and skill, though they require players to level up before they can be wielded. This encounter sets the tone for the journey ahead, highlighting the importance of patience, strategy, and growth.

For those who fall, the encounter with **Melina** and **Torrent** in the Stranded Graveyard offers a chance for rebirth and a reminder of the guidance that awaits those who persevere.

### Chapel of Anticipation Flora and Architecture

The Chapel of Anticipation is a peculiar fusion of architectural elements, with influences from both Stormveil and Leyndell, creating a structure as enigmatic as its purpose. Its design, characterized by a mix of rounded and pointed arches, suggests a blend of different eras or perhaps an intentional juxtaposition of styles, reflecting the complex history of the Lands Between. The presence of **Leyndell statues amidst Stormveil architecture** could imply a convergence of cultural or political significance, hinting at a deeper narrative thread connecting the chapel to the golden lineage and the broader game world.

This architectural amalgamation is further complemented by the flora found within and around the chapel, which exhibit an unusual golden hue, reminiscent of the **Erdtree's influence**. The golden plant life at the Chapel of Anticipation is particularly striking, with leaves that possess a **metallic sheen akin to those found at the Elden Throne**. This suggests that the chapel might serve as a testing ground for the effects of gold on plant life, possibly orchestrated by Godrick in his pursuit of becoming the lord of all that is golden.

The bioaccumulation of gold within these plants mirrors the process observed in the Erdtree Sanctuary, where the fallen leaves imbue their golden properties into the surrounding flora. This transformation could symbolize the **Tarnished's journey**, guided by the Grace of Gold, as they navigate the challenges of the Lands Between. The chapel's unique flora and architectural choices may thus reflect the themes of **anticipation and transformation**, serving as a prelude to the Tarnished's quest to mend the Elden Ring.

### Chapel of Anticipation Theories

The **Chapel of Anticipation** is a nexus of mystery and speculation within the game's lore, its architectural and symbolic elements sparking a multitude of theories among players. Many believe this location is a transitory space, a metaphysical gateway for the **Tarnished** returning to the Lands Between. The presence of the **Grafted Scion**, a formidable guardian, suggests its purpose may be to test or deter those who arrive through this entryway, perhaps indicating its role in filtering the \"rightful\" heirs, like Godfrey, from other Tarnished.

Furthermore, the architectural oddities and the enigmatic **golden flora** have led to various interpretations. Some theorists propose that the chapel's design—a blend of **Stormveil architecture with Leyndell influences**—hints at a deeper connection to the **Golden Lineage**, possibly serving as a monument to the anticipated return of Godfrey and his Tarnished. The golden plant life, reflective of the Erdtree's influence, might symbolize the **grace guiding the Tarnished** back to their destined path, or perhaps it is a byproduct of Godrick's experiments with gold.

This speculation is compounded by the chapel's isolation and the presence of **Stormhawk ashes**, suggesting a deliberate effort to maintain this site as a strategic or symbolic location. These elements combine to form a tapestry of intrigue, with the Chapel of Anticipation remaining a focal point of unanswered questions and ongoing discourse within the community.
