<!-- # The Enigmatic Elden Beast: Unraveling the Mysteries of the Celestial Guardian -->

The **Elden Beast**, a name that resonates with whispers of mystique and power, occupies a central role in the Lands Between. This celestial entity, intertwined with the very essence of the Erdtree and itself the true form of the Elden Ring, is more than just a creature; it is a symbol of the cosmic order and the divine mandate that governs the realm.

### Understanding the Elden Beast: Origins and Lore

Few entities are as enigmatic as the Elden Beast. Its origins lie in the stars, sent as a **golden harbinger by the Greater Will** to enforce the cosmic decree of Order. The convergence of its essence with the Erdtree birthed the Elden Ring, an artifact of immense power and the very foundation of the Golden Order.

**It is through the Elden Ring that Marika, the Numen Empyrean, ascended to godhood**, becoming the vessel of this profound mandate. **Her reign was characterized by the establishment of the Golden Order**, though it would eventually be marred when she **shattered the Elden Ring**, an event that led to her imprisonment within the Erdtree and the subsequent unraveling of the Golden Order.

This primeval beast was bound to the fate of the Erdtree and Marika herself, entwined in a symbiotic relationship that transcended mere physicality. It is within this context that the Elden Beast's significance must be understood—not as an independent entity, but as an integral part of a divine framework, embodying the immutable concept of order that the Greater Will intended to impose upon the world. Its role as a vassal is both a privilege and a burden, one that necessitates its existence to be both revered and feared, for it is the custodian of the world's balance, holding sway over the very fabric of reality in the Lands Between.

### What Exactly is the Elden Beast?

To truly grasp the concept of the Elden Beast, it's crucial to consider its distinct role in the cosmic order. While it shares a connection with celestial beings such as Astel and Metyr, it is unique in its own right. The Elden Beast was sent with a divine purpose, unlike Astel, which was more akin to a tool of destruction and lacked the same destined significance.

The Elden Beast is not just another daughter of the stars; it is the progeny of a divine will, a true child ordained to embody order within the cosmos. It is a spirit in the truest sense, transcending the corporeal to exist within and as the Elden Ring, revealing a connection to the spiritual realm that parallels the existence of the Regal Ancestor Spirit.

### Why Does the Elden Beast Fight You?

![Elden Beast Fight](~/assets/images/elden-beast/elden-beast-fight.webp)

**To stand before the Elden Ring is to challenge it**. With our own set of beliefs and principles, we journeyed across the Lands Between, defeated demigods and acquired their Great Runes, set the Erdtree on fire, and defeated Marika's other half, Radagon. And now you stand before the Elden Beast, which now **perceives the Tarnished as a force that threatens the remnants of the Golden Order** it has for so long sustained.

On a metaphorical level, the conflict with the Elden Beast can be seen as a **rite of passage for the Tarnished**, a trial to prove their worthiness to inherit or reshape the world's destiny. The Elden Beast's resistance is perhaps a necessary crucible, one that ensures only a champion capable of grasping the weight of their choices ascends to the throne of the Elden Lord.

### Is the Elden Beast an Outer God?

The celestial nature of the Elden Beast and the cosmic powers it wields suggest an existence that transcends the terrestrial realm. This aligns with the attributes often ascribed to Outer Gods – beings of immense power and unknowable intention, existing beyond the physical confines of the world.

However, the Elden Beast's role within the Lands Between is markedly different from that of other entities that might be considered Outer Gods. Unlike the malicious or indifferent Outer Gods–the god of scarlet rot, the god of the Twinbird, the Frenzied Flame, Placidusax's unamed god–the Elden Beast possesses a clear purpose tied to the upholding of the Golden Order.

### Why Does the Elden Beast Have a Scar?

![Elden Beast Scar](~/assets/images/elden-beast/elden-beast-scar.webp)

**The scar that mars the Elden Beast's stomach is the work of Marika when she shattered the Elden Ring**. Since the Elden beast itself is the true form of the Elden Ring, the beast is thereby wounded. This scar could also be perceived as a symbol of vulnerability within the Elden Beast itself—a creature that, while divine and powerful, has been subjected to the consequences of the same cataclysm that has thrown the Lands Between into disarray.

In a realm where the Elden Ring's integrity is synonymous with the prevailing order, **the scar can also signify the critical injury to the world's underlying structure** and the chaos that has ensued from the Ring's shattering. It is a constant reminder of the instability that has been wrought upon the world and the urgent need for restoration.

As such, the Elden Beast's struggle against the Tarnished may be seen as an attempt to defend the remnants of the Golden Order it once perfectly represented, or perhaps a resistance against being reshaped by the hands that seek to mend the Elden Ring anew. This physical mark, thus, is emblematic of the broader narrative—a cosmos grappling with the repercussions of divine conflict and the Tarnished's role in shaping a new order from the fragments of the old.

### What Animal is the Elden Beast Based On?

Upon looking at the Elden Beast, one cannot help but be drawn to its dragon-like features—a form that is both majestic and mysterious. Yet, this is no ordinary dragon. Its design carries the alchemical significance of the Rebis, a symbol of unity and wholeness that transcends gender, **combining male and female qualities into a singular transcendent entity**, much like Marika and Radagon being two parts of a whole.

The dragon itself, in many cultures, is a creature of immense power and knowledge, often associated with the elements and the cosmos. In the case of the Elden Beast, its dragon-like appearance is elevated by the ethereal traits it shares with celestial beings, its body seemingly composed of the very fabric of the stars. Its celestial and dragon-like form underscores its status as a being of higher existence, empowered by forces beyond the mundane world, a fitting adversary for one seeking to reshape the very essence of the world.

### Elden Beast Arena Lore: A Cosmic Battleground

As I ponder the profound encounter within the Erdtree, where the Tarnished stands before the Elden Beast, the arena itself seems to reflect the cosmic and metaphysical essence of the confrontation. This is an expanse where the fabric of reality is woven with the threads of the celestial. The arena's design, with its ethereal and nebulous qualities, mirrors the star-borne nature of the beast and its divine mission.

Upon closer examination, the arena's boundless vista, dotted with astral bodies and permeated by a sublime glow, evokes the vastness of the cosmos. The fight is not solely for dominion over the Lands Between but also for the right to define the nature of Order itself. In this sense, the arena serves as the crucible for a new genesis, where the outcome will determine the reformation or continuation of the Golden Order as dictated by the victor's vision.

### Conclusion

In the end, the Elden Beast stands as a multifaceted symbol within the world of Elden Ring. From its divine origins and purpose as an embodiment of order to its cosmic battle against the Tarnished, the **Elden Beast challenges our understanding of divinity and the nature of power**. Its scar, a testament to the fractured world it seeks to uphold, and its dragon-like form, a reflection of its celestial majesty, add layers of depth to its character.The arena where it faces the Tarnished serves as a cosmic battleground, emphasizing the stakes of their confrontation.

As players engage with this complex being, they are invited to ponder the intricate lore that forms the backbone of the game's immersive narrative, and to consider their own role in shaping the destiny of the Lands Between.
