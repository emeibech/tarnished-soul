In the sprawling and mysterious world of Elden Ring, players encounter a multitude of characters, each with their own stories and secrets. Among them stands White Mask Varré, a figure shrouded in enigma and blood. Known for his unsettling war surgeon attire and his allegiance to Mohg, the Lord of Blood, Varré is a guide at The First Step. His presence represents a complex narrative of power, manipulation, and choice, as he seeks to recruit followers into Mohg's bloody dynasty.

### Who is White Mask Varré?

White Mask Varré is an **enigmatic figure** encountered early in the journey of Elden Ring, known for his distinctive war surgeon attire. This garb, marked by its unsettling bloodstains, belies the true nature of war surgeons, who are not healers but rather **mercy killers** tasked with ending the suffering of the wounded on the battlefield. Varré's past as a war surgeon intersects with his current allegiance to **Mohg**, a connection forged after he was abducted against his will but later became a fervent disciple, uniquely taming Mohg's cursed blood. His mask hides Mohg's emblem painted on his forehead, symbolizing his devotion.

Players first meet Varré at **The First Step Site of Grace**, just as they embark on their quest in the Lands Between. Initially, he presents himself as a guide, offering advice to the **Tarnished**, who he refers to endearingly yet condescendingly as "Lambkin."

However, beneath this facade lies his true purpose: to **recruit followers for Mohg's dynasty**. His role evolves as players progress through the game, where he tests their loyalty and offers them the chance to join Mohg's ranks. Varré's presence at this critical juncture in the player's journey is no accident, as he seeks to sway the Tarnished away from the guidance of the Two Fingers, ultimately serving the ambitions of the **Lord of Blood**.

### Why is Varré Waiting for Us at The First Step?

**White Mask Varré** strategically positions himself at **The First Step**, the initial point of contact for many **Tarnished players** embarking on their journey in the **Lands Between**. This location is a critical juncture where newly arrived Tarnished, still grappling with their **maidenless status**, are most vulnerable and impressionable. By situating himself here, **Varré can immediately engage with the Tarnished**, presenting himself as a beacon of guidance amidst their obscurity.

His role as a recruiter for **Mohg's bloody dynasty** is underscored by his keen interest in identifying strong converts among the Tarnished. **The First Step**, with its proximity to the **Cave of Knowledge** where many Tarnished commence their journeys, is thus an ideal spot for Varré to begin his recruitment efforts, attempting to sway them away from the **Two Fingers** and towards allegiance with Mohg.

The First Step is not just a geographical location but a metaphorical beginning, representing a fresh start for the Tarnished and an opportunity for Varré to influence their path. By intercepting them at the outset, Varré capitalizes on the Tarnished's quest for purpose and power, sowing seeds of doubt about the established order, and enticing them with promises of strength and belonging within **Mohg's dynasty**.

His presence at such a pivotal location suggests a well-calculated plan to divert the Tarnished's ambitions towards serving the **Lord of Blood**, exploiting their lack of guidance and uncertainty to bolster the ranks of **Mohgwyn's dwindling followers**.

### How Does Varré Know That We Have Come for the Elden Ring?

Varré's awareness of the **Tarnished's quest for the Elden Ring** stems from the inherent purpose each Tarnished carries upon their return to the Lands Between. As the echoes of Marika's intentions reverberate through these lands, the summoning of the Tarnished serves as a clarion call to seek the shattered fragments of the Elden Ring. Varré, stationed at **The First Step**, is perceptive of this universal quest. His dialogue with the player, marked by his observation of their **maidenless state**, reveals his acute understanding of the Tarnished's plight and their inherent drive towards the Elden Ring. This knowledge is not mere conjecture but a calculated insight, as he positions himself to intercept and evaluate each Tarnished who emerges from their initial awakening.

The lore suggests that the **Lands Between are a realm of transition**, a place where the Tarnished are drawn by Grace's guidance to fulfill their destinies. Varré's role as a recruiter for the **Mohgwyn Dynasty** leverages this understanding, allowing him to discern which Tarnished possess the fortitude to be swayed from the path laid by the Two Fingers. His awareness is further amplified by the narrative that all Tarnished are drawn by the same call, a call that resonates with the ambition to mend the Elden Ring.

Varré's interactions with the Tarnished, marked by a mix of condescension and opportunity, are underpinned by his deeper agenda. This agenda is to **identify those who might doubt the established order** and join Mohg's burgeoning dynasty, promising them a new purpose that diverges from the conventional path.

### White Mask Varré's Lore and Ultimate Goal

White Mask Varré's enigmatic presence in Elden Ring is deeply entwined with his history and transformation under the influence of **Mohg, the Lord of Blood**. Once a war surgeon, Varré was abducted by Mohg for his unique talent with blood incantations, a skill that eventually enabled him to "tame" Mohg's cursed blood. His eventual worship of Mohg marks a significant transformation, as he becomes a fervent disciple of the Lord of Blood, demonstrated by the **emblem of Mohg painted on his forehead**. Varré's transformation from a reluctant captive to a devoted follower signifies a complex narrative of power, manipulation, and perhaps a twisted form of reverence.

Varré's ultimate goal revolves around the **establishment of a new dynasty under Mohg**, enticing the Tarnished into his fold through a facade of guidance and camaraderie. His methods are as deceitful as they are calculated, testing the Tarnished's allegiance by sowing seeds of doubt against the Two Fingers and offering an alternative path through the bloody dynasty of Mohg.

Varré's test for the Tarnished involves acts that challenge their moral compass, such as **soaking a cloth in a maiden's blood**, which serves as a rite of passage into Mohg's service. Through these trials, Varré seeks to identify those who are willing to embrace the blood-soaked vision of Mohg's dynasty, ultimately aiming to build a following that mirrors the **strength, vision, and love he perceives in his master**.

### What Happens If You Kill Varré?

In the world of Elden Ring, eliminating **White Mask Varré** carries significant consequences for the player. If Varré is defeated, he drops **500 Runes** and **six Festering Bloody Fingers**, which are useful for invasions. However, if the player invades him at Mohgwyn Dynasty, they can obtain additional rewards: a **Furcalling Finger Remedy**, a **Rune Arc**, and **Varré's Bouquet**, but only after returning to the invasion sign and speaking with him once more. While these items are enticing, the act of killing Varré renders his questline incompletable, thus locking the player out of his unique narrative arc and the associated rewards, such as the **Bloody Finger** and the **Pureblood Knight's Medal**.

Killing Varré early on has broader implications for the player's journey. Without Varré's guidance, the player misses out on the opportunity to be inducted as a knight to serve **Luminary Mohg**, which grants early access to **Mohgwyn's Palace**. This access is not only significant for progressing through the storyline but also provides early entry to lucrative **Rune farming spots**. However, should players choose to eliminate Varré prematurely, they can still reach Mohgwyn's Palace through an alternative path via a **hidden teleporter in the Consecrated Snowfield**.

This choice highlights the intricate web of decisions players must navigate, each leading to different narrative and gameplay outcomes, ultimately enriching the player's experience within **Elden Ring's complex world**.

### The Significance of Varré's Questline

Varré's questline in **Elden Ring** explores allegiance, choice, and consequence within the game's intricate lore. As players encounter Varré at various points in their journey, they are presented with opportunities that challenge their understanding of the world and test their resolve. **Varré**, as a recruiter for the **Mohgwyn Dynasty**, offers players the chance to deviate from the path laid out by the Two Fingers, suggesting an alternative allegiance to **Mohg, Lord of Blood**. This choice symbolizes a rejection of the established order and an embrace of a new, albeit sinister, dynasty.

Through Varré's dialogue, players are introduced to the concept of grace and its guidance, which serves as a metaphor for the player's journey in the Lands Between. His questline invites players to question the motivations behind their actions and the true nature of the entities that govern this world.

The decisions players make during Varré's questline have profound implications for their understanding of **Elden Ring's world**. By choosing to follow Varré's guidance, players gain access to **Mohgwyn Palace**, a location rich with opportunities for rune farming and an early confrontation with Mohg himself. This path offers deeper insight into the game's themes of power, loyalty, and the cyclical nature of subjugation and rebellion.

Varré's questline serves as a microcosm of the broader narrative, highlighting the perpetual struggle for dominance and the allure of power that permeates the Lands Between. By engaging with Varré, players are not only rewarded with unique items and abilities but are also prompted to reflect on the moral complexities of their journey, enriching their understanding of Elden Ring's vast and enigmatic lore.

### Conclusion

White Mask Varré is proof of the intricate storytelling and moral complexity that Elden Ring offers its players. His questline challenges the Tarnished to reconsider their allegiances, face moral dilemmas, and explore the depths of their own ambitions. Whether players choose to follow Varré into the bloody embrace of Mohg's dynasty or defy his path, the decisions made echo throughout their journey, reshaping the world around them. Ultimately, Varré's presence in the Lands Between is a reminder of the ever-present allure of power and the personal cost of pursuing a new destiny in this enigmatic realm.
