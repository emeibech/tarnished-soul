This comparison implies a historical connection that transcends Roderika’s immediate circumstances.

The fact that Hewg, who is **bound by an entreaty from Queen Marika to forge a god-slaying weapon**, recognizes a shared hue in Roderika's eyes with this mysterious spirit tuner suggests a deeper narrative link. This connection may tie her to the enigmatic and powerful forces that have shaped the world.

Hewg's comments not only elevate Roderika's role but also weave her into the complex tapestry of **Elden Ring's lore**.
